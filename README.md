# Election-Outcome-Prediction---Advanced-Classification

To build and test advanced classifiers and prescribe strategies using data from 2010 Congressional elections, we intend to build a classifier that would predict the electionâ€™s outcome. The data set includes information about the campaign funds, social media (Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube) campaigns, and demographics (age, gender) of 941 candidates who were in race in the general elections for The 112th House of Representatives seats in The U.S. Congress.
